# University of Warwick Satellite Team

## WUSAT Overview
WUSAT missions are designed primarily to provide multi-disciplinary teams of student engineers the experience of applying a Space Systems Engineering Methodology to the development of a custom designed satellite that meets the needs of a client payload. For WUSAT-4, the payload client does not rely on this as their primary route to completing their FDSPP biological experiments in Space, but through this technological in-orbit trial mission all parties gain enormous benefit from the outcomes and from the reality of the client/provider relationship.

## WUSAT-4 Overview
WUSAT-4 is a 3U CubeSat designed to carry a Fluorescent Deep Space Petri Pod (FDSPP) experiment as its payload. The experiment is the work of the University of Exeter and the FDSPP module is designed and manufactured by Space Park Leicester (member of our Midlands Innovation Space Group).

## WUSAT-4 Team
WUSAT teams typically comprise eight 4th Year MEng students of mixed engineering discipline to meet the requirements of the mission at each stage. The teams also include other students who have expertise in e.g. Ground Station or specific requirements of the payload. These may be from earlier years, from other departments (non-engineering), or from a related institution (non-Warwick). The core eight MEng students change yearly.

## WUSAT-4 Expected Outcomes and Possible Future Applications
The main outcome of the WUSAT-4 mission is that all team members complete an in-depth experience of satellite design to meet a set of payload requirements, and if possible, we can achieve the technical objectives of operating FDSPP in LEO and implementing an appropriate communications system to capture and return data images from FDSPP to the ground. Future applications could include the use of technology and procedures developed by WUSAT-4 in future FDSPP ‘full experiment’ missions, as well as the possibility of future WUSAT missions providing an in-orbit test/demonstration for other biological experiments.
